<p><strong>Hi, my name is Yash Agarwal. I am currently in Dublin High school and I am in the 9th grade. Some career goals about me are I want to be in the IT industry. I am particularly looking into the software developer field or the analytics side of IT. For this, I would want to major in certain computer science courses. Some of my majors would be Computer Science and Computer Software Engineering. I want to pursue this career because I love to develop new things.<br><br>

Some important qualities I have is I am able to communicate. Especially in this field, you need to know how to communicate and talk to other people.I also know how to listen to other people. As important as giving feedback is, it's equally as important to know how to receive feedback. I am always open to take in input from other people and apply it to whatever task we are working on. One last skill is I am a team player.
<br><br>
Throughout my entire life, I have participated in many events. I am currently getting ready for track season for Dublin High School. I am a pole vaulter and hurdler. I played basketball for 7 years and won many tournaments and played all over the state. I also love to volunteer and have participated in many projects. I volunteer at the library and I almost reached 100 hours. During this time of the pandemic and staying at home I have discovered a new interest in photo editing. <br><br>

After reading this I hope you learned something about me. I am someone who can communicate and someone who can lead. In the IT world, these are two very important skills which are much needed. Apart from school I have also participated in many sports and have volunteered in the library. I would like to invite you to visit my website and checking out some of the projects which I have made and some of my references.
