<strong>Work Experience</strong><br>
<h2>Dog Sitting</h2><br>
<h3>During any time</h3><br>
<p1> During any time of the year mostly on long weekends, I dog sit. The dogs usually stay at the owner’s home if they live in my community but if it were to be outside then it would stay at my house. I usually take it for walks, make sure the food and water are filled, and sometimes give them a shower.

<h2>Scratch project</h2><br>
<h3>CSP</h3><br>
<p1> Our first project in CSP we had to make a game from scratch. My partner and I decided that we wanted to make our own version of flappy bird. We added more levels and made it more challenging as the level goes on.

   <strong>Work Experience</strong><br> <h2>Library Volunteering</h2><br> <h3>During the Summer of 2018</h3><br> <p1> In the summer I volunteered at the library. In the summer there they have some games where you read a certain amount of books and you can get prizes. I was one of the workers at the table checking off children’s books that they read and giving prizes.

<p1> The second project that we did for CSP was our App Inventor project. We had to remix a tutorial and make it a game. My partner and I remixed colored dots and made it into a Pictionary.
